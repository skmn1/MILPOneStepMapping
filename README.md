The MILP model presented in this repository, is an implementation of the one step deployment formulation which is described in the paper "the Optimizing the deployment of tree-shaped functional graphs of real-time system on distributed architectures". The model is implemented using the OPL language. The project can be directly mounted and run inside the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.
